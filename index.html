             <h1>Automatic gates & barriers</h1>
         <p>West Gates & Security can Install, maintain and repair an extensive range of automatic gates and barriers to suit your needs in domestic, commercial or industrial environments. Gates and barriers can be a valuable solution to control or restrict access to your private or business premises from unwanted visitors or intruders while allowing authorised staff and guest access whenever they are authorised to do so. <br><br>Gates on domestic premises add a layer of protection for your home as intruders would need to make a conscious effort to gain access to your property and the intruder is likely to look elsewhere.

             <h1>Fibre optics & Networking</h1>
              <p>Fibre optic cables offer a range of benefits that go far beyond what is expected from traditional copper cables. Fibre optics are capable of transmitting data at a much higher bandwidth, as well as carrying signals at speeds that are about 30% slower than the speed of light. They are also sturdier, much more reliable, and can carry signals at much longer distances than copper cables.<br><br>The true value of fibre optic installation is in the future-proofing of your business. They serve as an ideal method of protecting information security, and can vastly increase productivity via eliminating speed issues that may arise. </p>

             <h1>CCTV & intruder Alarms</h1>
              <p>West Gates & Security can design, install, maintain and repair any type of CCTV system, to suit your needs and requirements. CCTV alone is a massive deterrent and often prevents crime before it occurs. It is useful for preventing and detecting criminal activity as well as monitoring the safety and wellbeing of people and property.
                  <br><br>Intruder alarms are the basis of most building security systems and are fitted as standard in almost all commercial and industrial premises for good reason. The cost to have an Intruder alarm installed can be a fraction of the cost to replace damaged or stolen property or items from your home or business</p>
